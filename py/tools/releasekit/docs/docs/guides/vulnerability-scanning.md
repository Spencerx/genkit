description: Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities via OSV.dev before publishing.

# Vulnerability Scanning

ReleaseKit queries the [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev/) vulnerability
database before publishing to catch known vulnerabilities in your
workspace dependencies.

---

## How It Works

```text
releasekit check --osv
  │
  ├── Collect Package URLs (purls) from workspace packages
  │   e.g. pkg:pypi/requests@2.28.0
  │
  ├── POST https://api.osv.dev/v1/querybatch
  │   body: { "queries": [{"package": {"purl": "..."}}] }
  │
  └── Filter results by severity threshold
      └── Report HIGH + CRITICAL vulnerabilities
```

---

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Scan for vulnerabilities.
releasekit check --osv

# Set severity threshold (default: HIGH).
releasekit check --osv --osv-severity medium

# Output:
# 🔴 CRITICAL: GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx in pkg:pypi/foo@1.0
#    CVE-2026-12345 — Remote code execution via deserialization
#    https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
# 🟠 HIGH: GHSA-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy in pkg:pypi/bar@2.0
#    Memory corruption in parser
```

## Severity Levels

| Level | When to Worry |
|-------|--------------|
| **CRITICAL** | Actively exploited, immediate action needed |
| **HIGH** | Serious vulnerability, fix before release |
| **MEDIUM** | Notable issue, plan to fix |
| **LOW** | Minor issue, fix at convenience |

---

## Fail-Open Behavior

OSV scanning is **fail-open** — if the OSV API is unreachable (network
error, timeout), the scan is skipped with a warning. This prevents
OSV outages from blocking releases.

---

## Complementary Tools

OSV scanning complements ecosystem-specific tools:

| Tool | Ecosystem | What It Does |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `pip-audit` | Python | Audits installed packages against PyPI advisories |
| `npm audit` | JavaScript | Audits npm dependencies |
| `osv-scanner` | Universal | Google's CLI for OSV.dev |
| **ReleaseKit OSV** | Universal | Built-in batch query against OSV.dev |
