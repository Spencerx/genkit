# SBOM Generation

ReleaseKit generates **Software Bills of Materials** (SBOMs) that list
every package in a release with its version, license, supplier, and
dependency relationships.

SBOMs are **generated automatically** during `releasekit publish` — no
extra CLI step is needed.  ReleaseKit follows a secure-by-default
philosophy: both CycloneDX and SPDX formats are produced on every
release.

SBOMs are required for supply chain compliance by:

- [Executive Order 14028](https://www.nist.gov/itl/executive-order-14028-improving-nations-cybersecurity) (US federal agencies)
- [NIST SP 800-218](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final) (Secure Software Development Framework)
- Many enterprise procurement policies

## Supported Formats

| Format | Standard | File Extension |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **CycloneDX** 1.5 | [OWASP CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) | `.cdx.json` |
| **SPDX** 2.3 | [Linux Foundation SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) | `.spdx.json` |

Both formats are generated by default.

---

## How It Works

SBOMs are generated at the end of `releasekit publish`, after all packages
are published and SLSA provenance is written.  The output files appear in
the workspace root:

```text
py/
├── sbom.cdx.json        # CycloneDX 1.5
├── sbom.spdx.json       # SPDX 2.3
├── provenance.intoto.jsonl
└── ...
```

No separate CLI command is needed — `releasekit publish` handles
everything.

---

## Configuration

SBOM generation is **on by default** with both formats.  To customize:

```toml
[workspace.py]
# SBOM generation is enabled by default (secure-by-default).
sbom = true

# Output formats — both are generated by default.
# Allowed values: "cyclonedx", "spdx".
sbom_formats = ["cyclonedx", "spdx"]
```

To disable SBOM generation (not recommended):

```toml
[workspace.py]
sbom = false
```

## SBOM Contents

Each component in the SBOM includes:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **name** | Package name | `genkit` |
| **version** | Released version | `0.5.0` |
| **purl** | [Package URL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) | `pkg:pypi/genkit@0.5.0` |
| **license** | SPDX license ID | `Apache-2.0` |
| **supplier** | Organization name | `Google LLC` |
| **dependencies** | Direct internal dependencies | `["genkit-core"]` |

---

## Verification

Use `releasekit compliance` to check that SBOM generation is enabled:

```bash
releasekit compliance
```

The report shows a ✅ for "SBOM generation" when it's configured.

## Integration with CI

SBOMs are generated automatically during `releasekit publish`.  Upload
them as release artifacts in your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Upload SBOMs
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: sbom
    path: |
      py/sbom.cdx.json
      py/sbom.spdx.json
```
